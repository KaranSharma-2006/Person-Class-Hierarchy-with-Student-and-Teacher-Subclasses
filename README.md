# Person-Class-Hierarchy-with-Student-and-Teacher-Subclasses
Create a base Person class that has properties like name and age, and a method to display basic information. Then, create two subclasses: Student and Teacher, each extending Person. The Student class should include an additional property like grade or course, and the Teacher class should include a property like subject or department.
